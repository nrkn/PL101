Unimplemented from MML:
  nx - note x - need way to translate this to octave/note
  < & >
  v - ignore

Timing:
  Figure out durations, taking into account:
    tempo
    len 
    duration
    extend
    modifier
    Defaults are:
      tempo[32..255] 120
      len[1..64] 1
      octave[0..7] 4
      duration[1..64] 1
      extend 0 (if > 0 loop, each loop duration *= 1.5)
      modifier[lsn] n
      
  tempo is QUARTER NOTES PER MINUTE    
  modifier
    l = play note for full duration
    s = staccato - play note for 3/4 duration then rest 1/4
    n = normal - play note for 7/8 duration then rest 1/8    
  
  if duration is present it overrides len without changing len
  
  ok so it's not so hard!  

Implement MUS:
  sequence
    the whole thing is pretty much a sequence
  par
    extend mml syntax to have par - ',' seems to be used by at least one but maybe nicer 
  note
    where sequences have an odd number of elements
  rest
    from pause
    
Extended syntax (maybe):
  ( ) denotes sequence - defaults are reset
  , denotes par - defaults are reset
 

Would be nice:
  var x = expression
  include( x )  
  
So:

  a, 
  (ab),
  (ab,cd)  
  
  but this should work too:
    a,
    (b)
    
    or:
      ab,
      cd
      
    or:
    a,b,c,d
   
Tests - hah write them last :P

Comments - see tests muahahahaha
